## About the project
The **Lex-Atlas: Covid-19 (LAC19)** project was launched in September 2020 and will provide a scholarly analysis of national legal responses to Covid-19 around the world. Updated across 2021, it will be published open-access by Oxford University Press. It is the produce of a vast collaboration of legal experts from across the world.

The project is motivated by the need for a comprehensive overview of national legal responses to Covid-19. The pandemic has many facets, and national responses have varied considerably. Quite apart from epidemiological performance, countries have employed emergency powers differently, have had different kinds of institutional disruption, diverged in public health measures, and have had variable social policy coverage and responses to the human rights needs of vulnerable groups. A scholarly overview of these legal responses is required both to assess past political choices and to prepare for future pandemics. Cataloguing them in detail will also be an important contribution to the history of the pandemic.  However, the complexity and fluid nature of the subject-matter essentially requires an unconventional scholarly approach. To make the international comparisons valuable, it requires a high degree of coordination between distinguished national legal experts, a large editorial team applying a consistent methodology, and the capacity to change national portraits as the law and policy shifts in line with the evolution of the pandemic.

The project seeks to meet this need through a world-wide collaboration between legal scholars. The project’s core deliverables include a **Compendium of Country Reports**, a **Database**, and a **Final Report** covering best and worst practices in the views of the project's Editorial Committee.  The project is committed to open-access, but has opted to work with Oxford University Press to maintain high production and editorial quality standards. No deliverable will be behind a paywall and all data will be held open source.  UCL, King's College London and the Max Planck Institute have funded open-access for this project.

## The LAC19 Compendium
The Compendium will comprise between 60 - 80 national reports written by teams of distinguished national legal experts on the relevant country’s legal response to Covid-19.  Each country's team is headed by a Country Rapporteur, and in most cases the teams are composed of scholars with a diverse range of topical expertise. The individual Country Reports will be produced by reference to a comprehensive Author Guidance Code, to be updated as the project evolves but applied by all authors, addressing the following subjects: 

**I. Constitutional Framework (e.g., executive, legislative, division of powers)**  

**II. Applicable Legal Framework (e.g., constitutional, statutory, exec rule-making)**  

**III. Institutions and Oversight (e.g., legislatures, courts, press, scientific advice)**  

**IV. Public Health Measures Imposed (e.g., quarantine, lockdown, travel, PPE)**  

**V. Social and Economic Measures Adopted (e.g. social security, labour, business)**  

**VI. Human Rights and Vulnerable Groups (e.g. privacy, race, gender, migrants)**  

Each report will range from between 15,000–20,000 words and is written in a neutral, non-judgmental tone.  All entries are edited by Area Editors that sit jointly on the Editorial Committee and who ensure the outputs retain coherence and comparability.  All Compendium entries will be published open-access by Oxford University Press and updated three times across 2021.  All web references to primary legal materials, which are given priority, will be archived and available permanently through the project. The first phase of country reports is in production and will be published in February 2021 and include 22 countries.  The second and third phases will be published between May and August 2021. 

## The LAC19 Database
The country reports will contain data that can be compared quantitatively. Such data relates to the type of law-making activity; the type of emergency powers used; whether legislatures or elections were suspended; whether online proceedings were used in courts; and the character and proliferation of a variety of public health and social policy measures.  Whereas the Compendium will provide the legal and constitutional context as well as a description of the measures and related litigation, the Database will collate determinate and quantifiable data on these themes. It will allow users to conduct comprehensive cross-national comparisons and correlations with other known socio- economic, political and health data. Notably, the sample of countries in the study is selected with a view to diversity in the areas of region, income, legal system type, inequality, regime-type, and a variety of factors relating to rule of law, transparency, and ethnic division. It is also selected with regard to pandemic performance. 

## The LAC19 Final Report
The Final Report will be written by the Editorial Team, who will reflect on the global overview of distinct themes.  Also to be published open-access by Oxford University Press, the Final Report will comprise:  

1. an analytical overview of the data, identifying response trends and correlations to major socio- economic and health indicators; and 

2. an in-depth critical analysis of various thematic areas (e.g. privacy, civil liberties, migration), discussing what the editors consider to be best and worst practices in relation to different themes.  The Final Report will emerge from two workshops held in London in the fall of 2021.  

## The LAC19 Website
The project’s website will be a portal to all of the project’s deliverables as well as access to the LAC19 network of Country Rapporteurs for academic researchers and policy-makers that have further inquiries about a particular country’s legal response to Covid-19.  It will furthermore include webpages for each country in the study, detailing further developments, guest commentary, and references to secondary literature.  The website will generally host blog contributions by the Editorial Committee, guest authors and by Country Rapporteurs on national experiences and key themes. 


# Team
The lead investigators on the project are [Professor Jeff King](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/people/prof-jeff-king) and [Dr. Octavio Ferraz](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/dr-octavio-ferraz).  The project is principally located at the [Faculty of Laws, University College London](https://laws.ucl.ac.uk).  It is jointly supported by the [School of Law at King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/law), and the [Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law in Heidelberg](https://www.mpil.de/en/pub/news.cfm).   

One or more Country Rapporteurs are responsible for the content relating to particular countries and territories for the duration of the project.  There is also an International Advisory Board and a Scientific Advisory Committee to advise on the social science elements of the project.  

## Editorial Committee

The Editorial Committee provides strategic direction and oversight of the project. They edit all Country Reports and will author the Final Report.
