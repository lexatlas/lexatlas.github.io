The Lex-Atlas: Covid 19 project will produce 80 national reports written by local legal experts on the relevant countryâ€™s response to Covid-19, covering: (1) the constitutional/legal framework; (2) the functioning of institutions (e.g. legislatures, courts); (3) the core public health measures adopted; (4) the social and economic measures adopted; and (5) key legal measures in respect of civil liberties and vulnerable groups. It will create a database that can be used by anyone for qualitative and quantitative analysis, and experts will draw together findings across thematic areas.
