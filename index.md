## About the project
The **Lex-Atlas**: Covid-19 (LAC19) project is premised on the recognition of a need for a comprehensive overview of national legal responses to Covid-19. The pandemic has many facets, and nations have had different responses and variable success at controlling the spread of Covid-19. Quite apart from epidemiological performance, countries have employed emergency powers differently, have had different kinds of institutional disruption, diverged in the public health measures and have had diverse social policy and compensatory measures for vulnerable groups. A scholarly overview of these practices, arranging discussions in a way that facilitates genuine comparison, is required both to assess past political choices and future pandemic preparedness. The complexity of the subject-matter at the national level essentially requires, to make the international comparisons reliable, coordination between local experts and an a large editorial team applying a consistent methodology. 

The project seeks to meet this need through a world-wide and possibly unprecedented scholarly collaboration. The project’s core deliverables include a **Compendium of Country Reports**, a **Database**, and a **Final Report** written by fourteen internationally distinguished scholars on the legal responses to Covid-19 in up to 80 countries across all regions of the world.

## The LAC19 Compendium
The Compendium will comprise between 60 - 80 national reports written by teams of local legal experts on the relevant country’s response to Covid-19. The Country Reports will be produced by reference to a comprehensive Author Guidance Code, addressing the following subjects: 

I. Constitutional Framework (e.g., executive, legislative, division of powers)  

II. Applicable Legal Framework (e.g., constitutional, statutory, exec rule-making)  

III. Institutions and Oversight (e.g., legislatures, courts, press, scientific advice)  

IV. Public Health Measures Imposed (e.g., quarantine, lockdown, travel, PPE)  

V. Social and Economic Measures Adopted (e.g. social security, labour, business)  

VI. Human Rights and Vulnerable Groups (e.g. privacy, race, gender, migrants)  

Each report will range from between 15,000–20,000 words and is written in a neutral, non-judgmental tone.  Country Rapporteurs head up national teams of authors.  All entries are edited by Area Editors that sit jointly on the Editorial Committee and who ensure the outputs retain coherence and comparability.  All Compendium entries will be published open-access by Oxford University Press and updated three times across 2021.  All web references to primary legal materials, which are given priority, will be archived and available permanently through the project. The first phase of country reports is in production and will be published in February 2021 and include 22 countries.  The second and third phases will be published between May and August 2021. 

## The LAC19 Database
The country reports will contain data that can be compared quantitatively. Such data relates to the type of law-making activity; the type of emergency powers used; whether legislatures or elections were suspended; whether online proceedings were used in courts; and the character and proliferation of a variety of public health and social policy measures.  Whereas the Compendium will provide the legal and constitutional context as well as a description of the measures and related litigation, the Database will collate determinate and quantifiable data on these themes. It will allow users to conduct comprehensive cross-national comparisons and correlations with other known socio- economic, political and health data. Notably, the sample of countries in the study is selected with a view to diversity in the areas of region, income, legal system type, inequality, regime-type, and a variety of factors relating to rule of law, transparency, and ethnic division. It is also selected with regard to pandemic performance. 

## The LAC19 Final Report
The Final Report will be published open-access by Oxford University Press and will comprise:  

1. an analytical overview of the data, identifying response trends and correlations to major socio- economic and health indicators; and 

2. an in-depth critical analysis of various thematic areas (e.g. privacy, civil liberties, migration), discussing what the editors consider to be best and worst practices in relation to different themes.  The Final Report will emerge from two workshops held in London in the fall of 2021.  

## The LAC19 Website
The project’s website will be a portal to all of the project’s deliverables as well as access to the LAC19 network of Country Rapporteurs for academic researchers and policy-makers that have further inquiries about a particular country’s legal response to Covid-19.  It will furthermore include webpages for each country in the study, detailing further developments, guest commentary, and references to secondary literature.  The website will generally host blog contributions by the Editorial Committee, guest authors and by Country Rapporteurs on national experiences and key themes.
